# Love2D-Compiler
This is a collection of shell scripts used to compile Love2d projects to .love and .exe packages for easy distribution.

Simply put the files into your project and run `./build OUTPUT_NAME`

The output directory is `./.build/builds/` (the .build directory may be hidden depending on your system settings, make sure you enable "View Hidden Files")!

### Enjoy :)
